The increase in aviation emissions places substantial pressure on the environment, necessitating the development of effective mitigation strategies. Effective emission reduction policies urgently require high-resolution aviation emission data to facilitate comprehensive strategies and precise evaluation of mitigation potential. 

Here, we propose a framework to estimate aviation emission with open-source data and method and offer data product in from multi perspectives. We utilize real flight trajectories derived from Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data and implements TrajEmission method to construct a refined aviation emission dataset of carbon dioxide (CO₂), nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrocarbons (HC), aggregated at three spatial-temporal levels: airport, route, and airline. The high-resolution nature of this dataset provides robust multidimensional support for policymaking, thereby enhancing simulation accuracy and broadening potential application domains. The spatial distribution of aviation emissions exhibits variability across different scales, revealing more pronounced spatial heterogeneity.
